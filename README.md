## Key Dependencies

- **React Native**: Core framework
- **Expo**: Development framework and tools
- **expo-camera**: Camera functionality
- **expo-media-library**: Save photos to device

## How It Works

### Taking Photos

1. **Before Photo**:
   - Select a room from the tabs
   - Tap the "Take Photo" card
   - Camera opens with back camera
   - Take the "before" photo
   - Photo is saved with room name and number

2. **After Photo**:
   - After taking before photo, camera reopens automatically
   - Before photo appears as overlay to help align the shot
   - Take the "after" photo
   - Photo is saved and linked to before photo

3. **Combined Photo**:
   - After taking both photos, editor screen opens
   - Choose layout (Portrait or Landscape)
   - Combined photo is created automatically
   - Save to device photo library

### Storage

- **Metadata**: Photo metadata (room, name, timestamps) stored in AsyncStorage
- **Images**: Full-resolution images saved to device photo library in "ProofPix" album
- **Organization**: Photos organized by room and timestamp

## Building for Production
